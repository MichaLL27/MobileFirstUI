You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Design a MOBILE-FIRST web app UI called “AI Profile Directory”.
This is NOT a marketing site, but an app-like interface.

General style:
- Mobile-first layout (max-width around 420–480px, centered).
- Soft light background, white cards, rounded-xl, subtle shadow.
- Clean, modern SaaS style, similar to the existing hero I already have.
- Use only React components and Tailwind classes. 
- Do NOT use React Router or <Link> at all. Use simple divs/buttons with onClick placeholders.

Create the following UI screens INSIDE ONE COMPONENT for now, with conditional rendering based on a simple state (e.g. "screen: 'home' | 'profile' | 'join'").

1) Home / Search Screen:
- Top bar with:
  - App name on the left: “AI Profile Directory”
  - “Join” button on the right (small, rounded, filled button) that switches to the Join screen.
- Below, add a large search input:
  - Placeholder: “Search profiles by full name”
  - Full-width, rounded-2xl, slight shadow.
- Under the search input, show a vertical list of 3–5 example user cards.
  Each user card:
  - Circular avatar with initials (e.g., “DA” for Dor Aharonoff).
  - Full name (bold).
  - Role / Title (smaller text).
  - One-line summary.
  - Entire card is clickable (onClick -> open Profile View for that example user).

2) Profile View Screen:
- Back button at the top (“← Back”) that returns to Home.
- Large circular avatar at the top center with initials.
- Full name in big, bold text.
- Role / Title below.
- Section titled “About” with a paragraph of example text.
- Section titled “Skills” with pill-style tags (chips).
- At the bottom, a primary button: “Share profile” (no logic, just a button).

3) Join / Create Profile Screen:
- Back button at the top (“← Back”) that returns to Home.
- Title: “Join the directory”
- Short description: “Create your public professional profile so others can find you.”
- Form fields:
  - Full Name (text input)
  - Current Role / Title (text input)
  - About you (textarea)
  - Skills (text input with placeholder: “Product Manager, React, Cyber Security…”)
- At the bottom, a wide primary button: “Create my profile”.
- Below the button, small helper text: “In the future, AI will generate your profile text automatically.”

Implementation details:
- Use React useState to manage which screen is active and to store a small list of example profiles.
- For now, profiles can be hard-coded demo data.
- Focus on clean design, spacing, and mobile usability.
- Make sure everything looks good on a small mobile viewport.
