You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer and UX writer.

I already have a working mobile-first app called “AI Profile Directory” with these screens:
- Directory (home search screen with filters and profile cards)
- Create Your Profile (form + AI-generated preview)
- Profile View (public profile page)
- Filters bottom sheet
- Bottom navigation (Directory / Create / My Profile / Settings)
- Settings screen

Right now, all example content is focused on high-tech roles (Product Designer, Engineer, AI researcher, etc.).

I want you to KEEP the same layout, components, and overall visual style,
but CHANGE all the copy, placeholder text, examples, and filter options
so the app is clearly aimed at **low-tech / practical professions** such as:
- Electrician
- Plumber
- Delivery driver
- Taxi driver
- Baker / Cook
- Hairdresser / Barber
- Cleaner
- Caregiver
- Construction worker
- Store clerk / Cashier
- Kindergarten assistant
- Security guard
and similar jobs.

Make the wording SIMPLE, CLEAR, and friendly.
Assume many users are not tech-savvy.

Update the UI as follows:

1) App concept
- Keep the app name “AI Profile Directory” or change it to something more simple like “Job Profiles” if needed in the UI.
- Main message: “Find and create simple professional profiles for real-world jobs.”

2) Directory / Home screen
- Change the example profiles to low-tech jobs.
  Example cards:
    - “Roni Levi – Certified Electrician”
      Subtitle: “Specializing in home electrical repairs and small installations.”
    - “Sara Cohen – Home Cleaner”
      Subtitle: “Reliable weekly cleaning for families and offices.”
    - “Ahmed Nassar – Delivery Driver”
      Subtitle: “Same-day deliveries around Tel Aviv and nearby cities.”
- Search placeholder: “Search workers by full name”.
- Quick filter chips:
  - “Electrician”
  - “Plumber”
  - “Cleaning”
  - “Deliveries”
  - “Construction”
  - “Child care”
- Filter bottom sheet:
  - Role options: Electrician, Plumber, Cleaning, Driving, Construction, Food service, Child care, Other.
  - Work style: “Comes to your home”, “Works on-site”, “Remote not relevant” (or keep On-site/Hybrid/Remote but adapt text to make sense).

3) Create Your Profile screen
- Keep the same fields, but adapt labels & placeholders:
  - Full Name → keep as is.
  - Current Role / Title → example: “e.g. Electrician”, “e.g. House Cleaner”.
  - Location → “City / Area where you work” with example: “e.g. Tel Aviv area”.
  - Company → “Business name (optional)” with example: “e.g. Roni Electric Services”.
  - Skills → examples like:
    “e.g. Electrical repairs, AC installation, small renovations, emergency calls”.

- Free-text background textarea:
  - Title: “Your background (optional)”
  - Placeholder text more simple:
    “Write a few sentences about what you do, how many years you work, and what services you offer. The AI will turn it into a clear description for your profile.”

- Helper text under textarea:
  - “Anything you write here will be used by AI to explain your work in simple, professional words.”

4) Profile View screen
- Example profile content should be for a low-tech job, not a product designer.
  For example:
    Name: “Roni Levi”
    Title: “Certified Electrician”
    Location: “📍 Holon, Israel”
    Company: “💼 Roni Electric Services”
    About: 2–4 short paragraphs explaining:
      - Years of experience
      - Types of jobs he usually does (home repairs, short calls, small businesses)
      - Service areas (cities/regions)
      - Approach: reliable, honest, clear prices.
    Skills chips:
      - “Home electrical repairs”
      - “Short-circuit fixing”
      - “Lighting installation”
      - “Electric panel upgrades”
      - “Emergency calls”

- Keep the AI badge, but make it simple:
  - “This profile text was written with AI.”

5) Settings screen
- Update texts to match the low-tech audience:
  - Use simpler language, e.g.:
    - “Profile language” → keep.
    - “AI writing style” → maybe only “Simple” and “More detailed”.
  - For explanations, avoid heavy tech terms.
  - In “About the app”, explain:
    “This app helps workers in everyday jobs create a clear profile so people can find and contact them.”

6) General tone changes across all screens
- Avoid words like “SaaS”, “enterprise”, “LLMs”, “optimization”, “stealth startup”.
- Use simple words:
  - “What job do you do?”
  - “Where do you work?”
  - “What services do you offer?”
- Make sure all dummy names, roles, sample texts and helper strings are updated to low-tech professions.

Implementation:
- Go through all components and replace the old high-tech demo content with new low-tech examples.
- Do NOT change the structure, Tailwind classes, or state logic unless required by the text.
- The goal is the same app, but for blue-collar / practical workers.
