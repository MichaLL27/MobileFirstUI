You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Extend the existing mobile-first “AI Profile Directory” home/search screen with FILTERS, for a large database of users.

Tech:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- No routing, no backend logic
- Do NOT use <Link> (only buttons/divs with onClick placeholders)

Update the UI as follows:

1) Top Search + Filters Row
- Keep the existing search input: “Search profiles by full name”.
- On the right side of the search input (or below it on small screens), add a “Filters” button:
  - Rounded-full button
  - Icon + label: e.g. a funnel icon + “Filters”
  - When clicked, it should open a bottom sheet (use a state flag like `showFilters`).

2) Quick Filter Chips (optional, under search)
- Add a horizontal scrollable row of pill-style quick filters, for example:
  - “Design”
  - “Engineering”
  - “Product”
  - “Data / AI”
- Selected chip state: bold text and slightly darker background.
- Non-selected: light gray background, subtle border.

3) Filters Bottom Sheet (Modal)
- When `showFilters` is true, show a bottom sheet overlay:
  - Full-width panel anchored to the bottom of the screen.
  - Rounded-t corners, white background, soft shadow.
  - Dimmed dark overlay behind it.

Inside the bottom sheet, include sections with filters:

(a) Role / Function
- Label: “Role”
- Use pill-style multi-select chips:
  - Product, Design, Engineering, Data/AI, Marketing, Sales, Other

(b) Location
- Label: “Location”
- Simple text input with placeholder: “e.g. Tel Aviv, Remote, Europe”

(c) Seniority
- Label: “Seniority”
- Use radio buttons or pill chips:
  - Junior
  - Mid-level
  - Senior
  - Lead / Manager

(d) Work Style
- Label: “Work style”
- Toggle or chips:
  - On-site
  - Hybrid
  - Remote

4) Bottom Sheet Actions
- At the bottom of the sheet, add two buttons:
  - Ghost text button on the left: “Clear all”
  - Primary full-width button on the right (or below): “Apply filters”
- For now, the buttons only update local state (no real filtering logic required, just UI).

5) General Design Notes
- Keep everything mobile-first with max-width ~420–480px centered on larger screens.
- Use consistent paddings (px-4, py-3 etc.).
- Maintain the same font sizes, colors, and rounded cards style as the existing directory and profile screens.
- The list of example profiles can stay static for now, but visually it should feel like filters are ready to work.

Focus on clean, intuitive UX: the user can type a name, tap quick filter chips, and open the Filters bottom sheet to refine results by role, location, seniority, and work style.
Only implement the UI and state handling for showing/hiding and selecting filters.
