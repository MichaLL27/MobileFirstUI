Update the “Join / Create Profile” screen design to support AI-generated profiles.

Goal:
The user should NOT manually write their About section anymore. 
Instead, the UI should clearly show that the profile will be written automatically by AI.

General style:
Same clean, mobile-first design as the existing profile and directory screens. 
Use React + Tailwind CSS. No routing, no backend logic.

Make the following UI changes:

1) Header
- Keep the back button (“←”) on the left.
- Title: “Create Your Profile”.

2) Replace manual text fields with a minimal data collection form:
The user only enters:
- Full Name (text input)
- Current Role / Title (text input)
- Optional: Location (text input)
- Optional: Company (text input)
- Skills (text input with placeholder “e.g. Product Manager, React, Cyber Security…”)

3) Remove the “About you” textarea entirely.
AI will generate the About section automatically.

4) Add an “AI Preview Card”
Below the form fields, add a small preview section showing a placeholder profile card:
- Title: “AI-Generated Profile Preview”
- A small card with:
  • Name placeholder (e.g., “John Doe”)
  • Title placeholder
  • A short gray paragraph representing the About text (3 gray lines as skeleton)
  • Skills shown as faded chips

This card should look like an empty skeleton UI, indicating that AI will fill it soon.

5) Add a primary CTA button:
- Full-width button: “Generate My Profile with AI”
- Add a small AI sparkles icon if possible (✨)

6) Add helper text under the button:
- Small, muted text:
  “AI will instantly generate a polished professional profile for you.”

7) Important interaction notes (for design only):
- The AI button does not need to work now — only the UI layout.
- Use a clean visual hierarchy and plenty of vertical spacing.
- All components should remain mobile-first, centered layout, max-width ~420–480px.

8) Do NOT use <Link>. Use only buttons or divs with onClick placeholders.
Do NOT add project timelines or extra sections.

Create the final UI in React + Tailwind CSS with the updated fields and AI preview card.
