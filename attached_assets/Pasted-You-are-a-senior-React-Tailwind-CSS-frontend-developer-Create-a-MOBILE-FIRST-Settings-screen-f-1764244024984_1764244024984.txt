You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Create a MOBILE-FIRST “Settings” screen for the AI Profile Directory app.

Tech:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Mobile layout (max-width around 420–480px, centered)
- Do NOT use <Link> or React Router. Only buttons/divs with onClick placeholders.

Design requirements:

1) Top Bar
- Back button on the left (“←”) with onClick placeholder.
- Title: “Settings”.

2) Section 1: Account
- Card-style section with a small title: “Account”.
- Inside the card:
  - Row showing profile status:
    - Label: “Profile status”
    - Value text: “No profile yet” or “Profile: Dor Aharonoff” (hard-coded demo).
    - Small text button on the right: “View” or “Create”.
- Use subtle gray text for helper line under it:
  - “Manage your profile and account details.”

3) Section 2: Profile & AI
- Section title: “Profile & AI”.
- Inside:
  - Row: “Profile language”
    - Right side: segmented control / select with “English” and “Hebrew” (UI only).
  - Row: “AI writing style”
    - Small pills: “Professional”, “Friendly”, “Short”.
    - User can tap to select one (use state, highlight selected pill with blue background).
  - Row with a small button: “Regenerate my profile with AI” (primary outline button, no logic).

4) Section 3: Privacy
- Section title: “Privacy & visibility”.
- Row with:
  - Label: “Show my profile in public directory”.
  - On the right: a toggle switch (use a simple div styled as a toggle, controlled by state).
- Small helper text under the row:
  - “When turned off, your profile will not appear in search results.”

5) Section 4: Notifications (placeholder)
- Title: “Notifications”.
- Two rows with switches:
  - “Email me when someone views my profile”
  - “Send tips to improve my profile”
- Toggles are UI only (state-based).

6) Section 5: About
- Small card at the bottom with:
  - Title: “About AI Profile Directory”
  - Text: short description (2 lines).
  - Small muted line: “Version 0.1.0”
  - Text button: “Send feedback”.

7) Danger zone (bottom)
- Centered small red text button: “Delete my profile”.
- No actual logic, just placeholder.

General styling:
- Use stacked card layout with `rounded-xl`, `bg-white`, `shadow-sm` or light border.
- Use `space-y-6` between sections.
- Ensure the screen scrolls smoothly on mobile and has padding bottom to not hide behind the bottom nav.
