You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Design a MOBILE-FIRST “Settings” screen for my app (AI Profile Directory for low-tech jobs).

Tech:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first layout (max-width around 420–480px, centered)
- Do NOT use <Link> or React Router. Use simple buttons/divs with onClick placeholders.
- There is already a bottom navigation bar (Directory / Create / My Profile / Settings), so add enough bottom padding so content doesn’t hide behind it.

Screen layout:

1) Top Bar
- At the top, add a simple header:
  - Left: back button “←” with onClick placeholder.
  - Center/Right: title “Settings”.
- Light background, no heavy border.

2) Section 1: Account
- Card-style block with title “Account”.
- Inside the card:
  - Row with:
    - Left: label “Profile status”
    - Middle: value text, e.g. “No profile yet” (for now, hard-coded).
    - Right: small primary text button “Create profile”.
  - Small helper text under row:
    - “Manage your profile and account details.”
- Use `rounded-xl bg-white shadow-sm px-4 py-3 space-y-1`.

3) Section 2: Profile & AI
- Title: “Profile & AI”.
- Card with:
  - Row: “Profile language”
    - Right side: simple segmented control with two options: “English”, “Hebrew”.
    - Use state to highlight the selected one (blue background, white text).
  - Row: “AI writing style”
    - Small pills: “Simple” and “More detailed”.
    - Tapping a pill selects it (state, blue highlight).
  - At the bottom of this card, add a full-width outline button:
    - Label: “Regenerate my profile with AI”
    - Just a button with onClick placeholder, no logic.

4) Section 3: Privacy & visibility
- Title: “Privacy & visibility”.
- Card with:
  - Row:
    - Left: label “Show my profile in public directory”.
    - Right: toggle switch (use a rounded div with a circle inside, controlled by state).
  - Small helper text below:
    - “When this is off, your profile will not appear in search results.”

5) Section 4: Notifications (placeholder)
- Title: “Notifications”.
- Card with two rows, each with label + toggle:
  - “Email me when someone views my profile”
  - “Send tips to improve my profile”
- Toggles are UI only (local state).

6) Section 5: About the app
- Small card at the bottom:
  - Title: “About this app”
  - Short description (2–3 lines), e.g.:
    “This app helps workers in everyday jobs create a simple profile so people can find and contact them.”
  - Small muted text line: “Version 0.1.0”
  - Text button: “Send feedback”.

7) Danger zone
- At the very bottom of the screen, centered:
  - Small red text button: “Delete my profile” (no real functionality yet).

Styling:
- Use vertical spacing between sections: `className="space-y-6"` or `mt-6`.
- Cards: `rounded-xl bg-white shadow-sm border border-slate-100`.
- Labels: `text-sm text-slate-800`.
- Helper text: `text-xs text-slate-500`.
- Add `className="pb-24"` to the main container so content doesn’t hide behind the bottom nav.

Focus on:
- Clean, simple, friendly design for low-tech users.
- Safe, readable spacing and typography on mobile.
- Only UI and local state for toggles and selected options, no real backend logic.
