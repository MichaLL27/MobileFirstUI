You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Improve the "Profile View" screen of the AI Profile Directory app so that it looks great with a LONG About section (300–400 words, multiple paragraphs).

Tech:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first layout (max width around 420–480px, centered)
- Do NOT use <Link>. Only buttons/divs.

Make the following design updates:

1) About Section Layout
- Keep the "ABOUT" title as a small uppercase label with tracking-wide and muted gray color.
- Wrap the About text in a card-like container:
  - Rounded-xl
  - Soft background (#F9FBFF or similar very light tint)
  - Padding: p-4 or p-5
  - Subtle shadow or border: border border-slate-100
- Use typography that is comfortable for long reading:
  - className for the About text: 
    `text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed`
- Allow multiple paragraphs:
  - Use <p> tags with margin-bottom (e.g. `space-y-3` on the container).

2) Read More / Read Less (design + basic interaction)
- By default, show only the first part of the long About text (approx. 4–6 lines).
- Visually, the card should show:
  - The beginning of the text.
  - A subtle gradient fade at the bottom of the card to suggest more content, using a div with a top-to-bottom white fade (e.g. `bg-gradient-to-t from-white to-transparent`).
- Below the card, add a centered text button:
  - Label: “Read more” (when collapsed) and “Show less” (when expanded).
  - Style: small, blue text button with no heavy border.
- You can implement this with simple React state, e.g.:
  - `const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);`
  - When `expanded` is false: limit the height of the About card with `max-h-40 overflow-hidden`.
  - When `expanded` is true: remove the max height and gradient overlay.

3) Overall Profile Page Spacing
- Ensure there is generous spacing between sections:
  - About section should have `mt-6` or `mt-8` from the metadata (location/company).
  - Skills section should come after About with `mt-6`.
- Keep everything scrollable and clean on mobile.

4) Demo Content
- For now, hard-code a long About text with 3–5 paragraphs so the layout feels like a real long profile.
- The design should feel polished, calm, and easy to read even for long content.

Only update the Profile View screen. Focus on visual design and small interaction for the long About section.
