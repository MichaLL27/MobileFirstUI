You are a senior React + Tailwind CSS frontend developer.

Create a MOBILE-FIRST "Search Results" screen for the AI Profile Directory app.

Tech:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first layout (max-width around 420–480px, centered)
- Do NOT use <Link> or React Router. Use buttons/divs with onClick placeholders only.
- Assume this screen will be shown after a search on the home screen.

Design requirements:

1) Header Row
- At the top, create a small header bar with:
  - A back button on the left (“←”) to go back to the main search screen (use onClick placeholder).
  - A title: “Search results”.
- Keep it minimal, no heavy borders.

2) Search Summary
- Below the header, show a small summary line:
  - Example: “Showing 8 results for ‘dor’”
- This should use small, muted text: `text-xs text-slate-500`.

3) Results Filter Bar
- Under the summary, add a horizontal bar with:
  - On the left: “Sort by” small label.
  - A simple dropdown-style button (no real dropdown needed yet) with:
    - “Relevance” as default.
    - Down arrow icon (▼).
  - On the right side, a text button: “Clear search”.
- Make it compact and mobile-friendly.

4) Results List
- Under the bar, show a vertical list of user profile cards.
- Re-use the same style as the cards on the home screen, but slightly more detailed:
  - Circular avatar with initials.
  - Full name (bold).
  - Role / Title.
  - One-line summary/tagline.
  - Small muted line for location (e.g. “📍 Tel Aviv, Israel”).
- Each card should look like a tappable element:
  - White background, rounded-xl, soft shadow or border, padding.
  - Entire card clickable with an onClick placeholder that will open the Profile View screen.

5) Empty State
- If there are no results (e.g. list is empty), show an empty state in the center:
  - Icon (e.g. a magnifying glass or a simple circle placeholder).
  - Title: “No profiles found”
  - Subtitle: “Try a different name or adjust your filters.”

Implementation notes:
- Use hard-coded demo data for now: an array of 4–6 example profiles.
- Use React state to simulate the selected sort option (even if it doesn’t change much).
- Focus on clean spacing, readable typography, and a modern mobile directory feel.
- All content should scroll vertically.
